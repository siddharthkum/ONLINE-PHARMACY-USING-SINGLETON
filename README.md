# ONLINE-PHARMACY-USING-SINGLETON
The purpose of an online pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy 
and enhance safety, communication and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store by 
automating the existing manual system through the implementation of a computerized 
equipment, and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling all requirements, in the 
process of data management and maintenance of records related to stock, liquid flows, 
staffs, customers and suppliers. This system is an integration of an aspect in Information 
and Communication Technology (ICT).
This project aims to tackle the design problems that may arise during the 
development of Online Pharmacy Application. We intend to dive into the details of 
what problems may arise during the design phase of this system and how and what 
design patterns can be used to provide an optimal solution. 
The entire development process associated with a generic application like online 
pharmacy requires use of multiple call requests in as to achieve the overall functionality 
of the system. Now, when we start to build the system we come across design issues 
like coupling, cohesion, inheritance etc. 
Therefore in this project we will be mapping the construction of the online 
pharmacy with suitable design patterns in as to overcome this design and 
implementation issues.
